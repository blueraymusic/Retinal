## Retinal Anomaly Detection
 
**Explainable AI for Retinal Disease Detection using Deep Learning and GPT-4**

---

## Problem Statement
Early diagnosis of retinal diseases—such as **diabetic retinopathy**, **glaucoma**, and **macular degeneration**—is vital to prevent irreversible vision loss. Traditional manual diagnosis:
- Is time-consuming  
- Requires skilled ophthalmologists and if not diagnosed early cand correctly, could lead to irreversible vision loss.
- Can suffer from inter-observer variability
  

This project builds an **automated and explainable AI system** to assist healthcare professionals in detecting retinal anomalies accurately and interpretably.

---

## My Objective
To build an end-to-end AI pipeline that:
- Detects multiple retinal diseases from fundus images  
- Explains its predictions in **plain English** using **GPT-4**

The aim is to make diagnosis faster, more transparent, and educational—for both patients and practitioners.

## Project Overview

### 1. Multi-Label Retinal Disease Classifier
- **Model**: Transferring learning from  `ResNet50` (changed the 4th layer to train on the data, so as to keep the other trained features)
- **Dataset**: Fundus images from Kaggle + other public sources  
- **Labels**: Multi-label output for 7 retinal conditions  


### 2. Inference & Upload Interface
- Upload a retinal image via a CLI or web interface  
- The model:
  - Verifies image validity  
  - Preprocesses and predicts diseases (With Percentages)
  - Displays top diseases with confidence scores  
  - Explains the results via **GPT-4 API**

### 3. Explainability
- **GPT-4**: Converts technical predictions into human-readable summaries  

---

## OpenAI Integration
- GPT-4 receives:
  - Predicted diseases and confidence scores  
- GPT-4 responds with:
  - A **natural language explanation** for medical users

## Sample Output

![0e5235b62de8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9fbc550-1b09-4509-89aa-f4c3de6303ad)



\`\`\`
Prediction:
- Diabetic Retinopathy: 99.4%
- Opacity: 87.3%
- Macular Degeneration: <1%
\`\`\`

We suspect with high confidence the presence of diabetic retinopathy (99.4%), macular edema (<1%), and opacity (87.3%) in the retinal image. These findings suggest that the patient is likely experiencing significant eye health issues. Diabetic retinopathy is a condition where high blood sugar levels damage blood vessels in the retina, potentially leading to vision loss. Macular edema involves swelling in the macula, the part of the retina responsible for sharp vision, which can result in blurred or distorted vision. Opacity, such as cataracts, causes clouding of the eye's lens, reducing clarity and brightness of vision. These conditions are crucial to address as they can lead to serious vision impairment or blindness if left untreated.

## Future Directions (Optional)

-  Feedback loop for post-diagnosis correction and retraining 
-  Lightweight offline mode for clinics

# Retinal-Disease-Detection

Fundus imaging provides physicians with a snapshot of the inside of the patient's eye.
Doctors can read abnormalities present on a patient eye's retinal based on images of its interior.
Many eye diseases can be found using fundus images, such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and macular degeneration.

This project aims at training a deep learning model to detect different retinal diseases.
This is a multi-label classification problem as a retinal image can have multiple diseases.

The dataset includes 3,285 images from CTEH (3.210 abnormals and 75 normals) and 500 normal images from Messidor and EYEPACS dataset.
The abnormalities include: opacity, diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, macular edema, macular degeneration, and retinal vascular occlusion
